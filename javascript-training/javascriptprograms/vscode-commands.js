VS code Extension(plug in's):
==============================
       JavaScript (ES6) code snippets - 20.7M - To run program in VS code (understand JS program)
       Javascript and Typescript Nightly - 6.5M
       Javascript debugger - To debug the program
       code runner (.run) ------> code runner to get play button in VS code
       playrwright Test for VS code - 2M 

       // Now VS code is ready to run javascript programs
       


Terminal Commands:-
=====================

      npm install -g typescript    // Error occured - to solve it execute below command
      Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned   -----> command to solve Error msg while executing above command
      npm intall -D typescript ts-node
      npx tsc --init
      npm install -g tsx 
      npx tcs test.ts                    -----> It will convert Typescript program to Javascript then need to execute node foldername.js to run program
own - npm install -g ts-node typescript  -----> to install ts node
      npx ts-node test.ts                -----> Directly execute the typescript program file - To avoid mentioned above 2 line command 
      npm install --save-dev ts-node typescript

Own command to run typescript program:

      npm install -g ts-node
      npm install --save-dev ts-node
      node app.ts ==========================> to run javascript program file
      ts-node app.ts  ======================> to run typecript file

Others:
======

      1) json - Javascript object Notation
      2)  Cloud name : Binbucket,Github,Azure


================================== Doubts ======================================


7) function with optional parameter ===> "function-implementation.ts
8) Array or string methods - Don't we have return type as like in Java?=====> Keyboard shortcut to take return type
9) let a : any[] =[a,1,*.+,8,b,true,null,"dhana"] ===> How sorting happens? 
   let result = a.sort((a,b)=> a-b); // Array "random" having number,string,boolean
   console.log(result); 
10) For each ts file - can we maintain more than one default function?
     Modules----->"4.1-default-exports.ts"
11) Oops constructor concept : Do default constructor name should be Constructor() - Yes
    Refer : OOPS--> classes---> class-with-parm-constructor.ts program
12) Method overloading not possible in JS but possible in TS but node.js convert TS-->JS, At that time how it works
    Refer : OOPS---> Polymorphism--> polimorphism.ts program
13)  export{} at the end of program - why?
14)  Assignment 5 ---> Array declaration---> number[] instead of any[] --> program getting error
16)  Object key in keyof empDetails
17)  Assignment 1 - co-ordinates - latitude & longitude
18)  Difference between Console.log ( "Information" + a); & Console.log ( "Information", a);
6) GIT push code  


=====================================================================================================================================

1) Typescript program after changing folder - programs not running - RESOLVED
2) Playwright installation - Error - PROXY
3) tempCodeRunnerFile.ts --> file in polymorphism folder and module folder --> check- run time autogenerated file
4) By default - I don't have package.json - Manually i created that folder...? - INSTALLED
5) Iterate through object ---> "loop-statements.ts"

20) Typescript program - "function.ts" ---> getting undefined in terminal after running program  
19)  Keyboard shortcut key to align compile program - (shift+Alt+F)
15)  Do while loop - how to stop infinte loop in terminal -----> Crtl + c to kill the terminal

Playwright Installation and configuration in laptop

1) create playwright folder and open terminal and execute cd command
2) proxy setting command :  $env:HTTPS_PROXY="http://z048381:Dhanush189923@cosmos-vip.intra.renault.fr:3128"
3) proxy setting command : $env:HTTP_PROXY="http://z048381:Dhanush189923@cosmos-vip.intra.renault.fr:3128"
4) npm init playwright@latest ----> Playwright installation command
5) Typescript
6) where to put your end to end test ==> give folder name -->tests
7) configure with git ----> No (because we are going to use Azure)
8) npx playwright test ----> to run end to end compiled program
9) npx playwright show-report
10) npx playwright install ---> To download playwright browsers
11) npx playwright update ----> To install updated browser version

other terminal command displayed while installation:

12) npx playwright test --> to run end to end compiled program
13) npx playwright test --ui ----> Starts the interactive UI mode
14) npx playwright test --project=chrominum ----> Runs the test only on Desktop chrome
15) npx playwright test example   -----------> Runs the tests in a specific file
16) npx playwright test --debug   ------------> Runs the test in Debug mode
17) npx playwright codegen        ------------> Auto generate tests with codegen

Difference between install and init:

   npm install --> Typescript  - it is a additional software package installing in our computer and later by using this we are going to build the project
   npm init   ---> playwright - it is not additional software it is framework - it will setup entire project
